## Problem Statement

High employee attrition presents a significant challenge for organizations, impacting workforce stability, operational efficiency, and talent retention. Understanding the key drivers behind attrition—such as job satisfaction, demographics, education levels, and departmental trends—is crucial for developing effective retention strategies. However, many companies lack a centralized, data-driven approach to analyze employee turnover. This HR Analytics Dashboard provides actionable insights into attrition rates, employee demographics, and reasons for leaving, enabling organizations to identify patterns, optimize workforce planning, and enhance employee engagement initiatives.
